HuResearch
 HuResearch is a lightweight, privacy-first academic research engine that brings together results from multiple open scholarly databases in a single interface.
Built as a fully client-side web application, HuResearch is designed for students, researchers, and independent scholars who want fast access to academic research papers without logins, trackers, or paywalls.

WHY HURESEARCH

Academic research tools are often fragmented, slow, or locked behind institutional access. HuResearch aims to reduce that friction by acting as a meta-search layer over trusted public repositories, while keeping the experience simple and transparent.
